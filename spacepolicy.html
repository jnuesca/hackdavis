            Americans took pride in their efforts to bring a man to the Moon by
            the end of the decade, and it was ultimately this dedication that
            allowed for its successful fruition.</p>

            the home to many experiments especially in the realm of crew
            survival and solar observations. This project is known as the
            precursor to the International Space Station. Following six years
