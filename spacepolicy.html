        <p>
          This was the launch of the world's first artificial satellite into orbit by the Soviet Union. The satellite fell out of orbit
          and burned up in the atmosphere the next year, but marked the beginning of the space race.

      <h2> July 29, 1958 </h2>
      <h3> National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 </h3>
      <p>
        This act created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and outlined their purpose. NASA was tasked
        with expanding human knowledge. They were also strictly limited to peaceful operations, so that space would not become
        the battlefield for World War III. However, this Act was an escalation of the arms race, which had built up after WWII
        between the United States and the Soviet Union. Read more <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Act"> here </a>
